## 👩‍💻 About Me

I build practical, end-to-end systems that combine data, machine learning, and clean user-facing applications.

My interests span:
- Data analysis and model building  
- Machine learning system design  
- LLM-powered applications  
- Backend APIs and scalable services  
- Frontend interfaces for intelligent systems  

I enjoy working across the stack — from data preprocessing and model experimentation to deployment and UI integration.
